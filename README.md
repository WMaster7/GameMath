# Game Math

Educational game development math, progressive from beginner to advanced. Allowing for logic in 2D and 3D games.</br>
Mainly with illustrations for clarity.

**Motivation:** To help people achieve in creating features they would like to create! As well as documenting advanced topics for myself as a reminder of how they work.

Adding content in a random fashion, so not necessarily from beginner to advanced. Difficulty is estimated by myself and may be shifted around in later stages.
