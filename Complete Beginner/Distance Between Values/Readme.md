## Distance Between Values

Object locations (or locations in general) are often stored as numerical values.</br>
This can be decimal values (for example: 2.23) or whole numbers. (also called integers.)</br>

Let location A be 5.</br>
Let location B be 12.</br>

To get the distance going from one location to another, you take the target location and subtract the location where you're coming from from it.</br>

You could think of it like the following: I need to be at 12, but I'm already at 5, thus 12 - 5 will get the remaining distance of 7.</br>

This works the same the other way around.</br>
The distance from B to A will be 5(A) - 12(B) = -7</br>
**Negative distances simply mean facing the other direction.**</br>

**Summary:** Distance from one to the other is **(Target location)** minus **(From location)**
